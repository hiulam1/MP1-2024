In a quiet room, with sunlight faint,
A secret hides, beneath the paint.
From the bed to the table, let your search commence,
Between two points, where things grow tense.
Start at two-eight-eight, and go to three-three-eight,
A hidden thread, a twist of fate.
This key you find, though hard to see,
Unlocks the forest where trees run free.
Pay close attention to what appears,
Clear letters hold the key to your cheers.
