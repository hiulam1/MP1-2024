In Van Goghâ€™s orchard, pure and bright,
Two numbers hide in the painter's light.
From the first, start at the very beginning,
Count up to fifty, where the colors are thinning.
The second clue is where the tale begins,
At zero, where the image truly spins.
Explore the hues, and you might just see,
The numbers that hold the key to your mystery.
